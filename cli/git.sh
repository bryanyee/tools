### git-stash

# Advanced Stash
git stash --keep-index            # git add files to staging to keep them in staging, and save the whole diff to a stash.
git stash save --patch <message>Â  # Interactively choose which files to stash.

# To apply the changes from only some files in a stash:
git checkout stash@{#} -- <path>

# To apply a stash that has been dropped:
git stash apply <stash_hash>


### git history

# Find the last commit(s) that affected a (deleted) file:
git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <path>          # Returns the commit
git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <path> #  Retrieves the deleted file

# Find if a commit exists in a branch:
git log --oneline | grep <sha>
git branch --contains <sha>

# Search for commits that changed the number of occurrences of a string:
git log -S <string>        # Retrieves the commit
git log -p -S <string>     # Retrieves the commit and its diff
git log -S <string> <path> # Scoped to a particular file path, retrieves the commit

# Finds all commits involving the matched regex:
git log -G <regex>
git log -p -G <regex>
git log -G <regex> <path>


### git tags
git fetch --all --tags                    # Fetch all tags
git tag -l                                # List all tags
git checkout tags/<tag> -b <branch>       # Checkout a branch for a tag
git checkout tags/4.2.2 -b v4.2.2-branch


### Diffs

# View file names only in a diff
git diff --name-only <sha> <sha>

# View diff and ignore changes in whitespace (such as if code gets wrapped in a block and becomes indented)
git diff -w  # git diff --ignore-all-space
